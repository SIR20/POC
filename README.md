Starting server chat:

1. Files:

1.1. Server computer must have [Server.exe](https://github.com/SunSerega/POC/raw/master/Server.exe)

1.2. Client computer must have [Client.exe](https://github.com/SunSerega/POC/raw/master/Client.exe)\
(if you want to both run server and be in chat - you should have botw .exe's)

1.3. Both Client and Server need [server adress.txt](https://github.com/SunSerega/POC/raw/master/server%20adress.txt), which must contain ip and port of server computer.\
It should look something like `11.22.33.44:11000` (before `:` is ip and after is port)\
All computers that supposed to connect - must have same ip and port.

2. Getting ip and port:

If you don't know how to portfoward - you should use things like hamachi.\
In that case, copy your ip from hamachi (or whatever you use) and choose any port number.\
Then send complite file to all people who you want to join.

3. Launching:

First always start Server.\
Then - start your Client and say to other to other people to start their Clients.
